In this tutorial, I have made a working fan using javascript.

On clicking the power button the fan blades will rotate in clockwise direction until you do not off the button.

And there is also a fast mode button which rotate fan-blades with increasing speed.

* addEventListener()
* Toggle between class.
* How to make animation.
